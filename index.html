# What is a web host?
<p class="delayed">A web host is just a computer that **serves** a website to visitors. (You'll also hear them referred to as **servers**.)</p>

Our own computers can be web hosts, too &mdash; that's how we've been viewing our websites so far.<!-- .element class="delayed" -->

We probably don't want strangers being able to access our personal computers, and we want to be able to turn our computers off without preventing people from visiting our websites.<!-- .element class="delayed" -->

Web hosts solve both these problems by being separate computers from our own, and being powered on almost all the time.<!-- .element class="delayed" -->

# Netlify
There are lots of web hosts out there, but today, we are going to use **Netlify**. There are a few reasons for this:

- It's easy to transfer files from our own computers onto Netlify's servers
- It has a free tier that should be fine for our needs
- It lets us customize our subdomain names (more on that later!)
- All sites are automatically encrypted, making them more resistant to hackers

# Creating your first site
1. Open **Windows Explorer** *(Windows)* or **Finder** *(MacOS)* and navigate until you can see the folder that contains your website 
1. Drag that folder onto the rectangle that says **Drag and drop your site folder here**
1. Wait a second. A URL will appear at the top of the page.

# What is a domain name?
<p class="delayed">All computers on the internet have a unique number assigned to them, called an **IP Address**. For example: **172.217.1.163** or **67.205.28.89**.</p>

<p class="delayed">These numbers are easy for computers to remember, but humans have trouble with them. Instead, we use **domain names**, which are words that correspond to those numbers. Instead of the two IP addresses above, a human would type **google.ca** or **canadalearningcode.ca**.</p>

<p class="delayed">For you to be able to use a domain name, that name must be registered by someone else, and we normally need to pay for that. However, Netlify allows us to change our subdomain name for free.</p>

# Subdomains
A subdomain tells the computer you're talking to what category of information you're asking for. <!-- .element class="delayed" -->

<p class="delayed">You've used a subdomain every time you've typed **www** into a browser. In **www.canadalearningcode.ca**, **canadalearningcode.ca** is the domain, and **www** is the subdomain.</p>

<p class="delayed">We're going to change our website's subdomain so that people can find it by typing ** *[YOUR-NAME-HERE]*.netlify.com**.</p>

# Updating your site
If we were to make some changes to our site on our computers, the online version of our site wouldn't update. **Why?**

<p class="delayed">Because our **web host** is a different computer!</p>

We need to upload the files from our computer onto our web host to see our changes online. <!-- .element class="delayed" -->

1. Repeat the steps you used to create your site
1. ***Make sure to use the same folder as before!***
